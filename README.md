# AC-Generator-Simulator
An interactive web-based simulator that demonstrates the working of an AC generator along with the principles of Faraday's and Lenz’s Laws. Users can drag magnets to change the magnetic field and observe the induced EMF through a visual voltmeter and waveform output.

# ⚡ AC Generator + Faraday + Lenz Law Simulator

🎯 **Purpose**  
This project simulates the generation of alternating current using the principles of Faraday’s Law and Lenz’s Law. It is designed for physics learners to visually understand how changing magnetic fields induce EMF in a rotating coil.

🚀 **Features**
- 🧲 Drag magnets to adjust magnetic field strength
- 🌀 Rotate the coil to simulate AC generation
- 🔁 Real-time animation of EMF induction and polarity changes
- 📉 Live sine wave graph of induced voltage
- 🧭 Functional voltmeter with moving needle
- 📱 Mobile-friendly interface with touch support

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- HTML5, CSS3  
- JavaScript (Canvas API)
